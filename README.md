# PreschoolWebsite23 â€“ Final Project Web Programming
This website was developed as a final project to support my mother's kindergarten. It is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, with dynamic pages for registration and contact handled through PHP and a config.php file containing database connection details. The structure features a consistent header linked across all pages for seamless navigation.

This prototype served as the foundation for the live website I later created at www.littleabqari.com.my, using Canva as the visual design platform and the initial project as a functional and structural guideline.
